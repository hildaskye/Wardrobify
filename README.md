## Design

## Shoes microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.

## Hats microservice

For the Hats microservice I created 2 models, Hat and LocationVO. LocationVO is polling from the Location model in the Wardrobe microservice. I created 2 views that allows a user to list, add, and delete, a hat. Then I created 2 forms using React, one to List the Hats, and the other to add a new hat. After that I integrated them into App.js and added the links to the Nav.js page.
